You'll learn how to manage application upgrades with a blue-green deployment
--

Estimated Time: 25 minutes

== Setup

. To simulate a blue-green deployment, first scale `attendees` to multiple instances.

----
$ cf scale attendees -i 2
----

== Perform a Blue-Green Deployment
. Read about using Blue-Green Deployments to reduce downtime and risk.
. Browse to the attendees Blue-Green page.
+

+
. Lets assume that the deployed application is version 1. Let's generate some traffic. Press the `Start` button.
+
_Leave this open as a dedicated tab in your browser. We will come back to this later._
+
. Observe our existing application handling all the web requests.
+
Start Load
+
. Record the hostname for the attendees application.
+
This is our production route. _You will use this in the next step._
+
For example:
+
----
-> cf routes
Getting routes for org mborges-org / space development as admin ...

space         host                                 domain                 port   path   type   apps                     service
development   attendees-doxastic-progenitiveness   apps.pcf.homelab.lan                        attendees
----
. Now let's `push` the next version of `attendees`.
+
However, this time we will specify the hostname by appending `-temp` to our production route.
+
For example (your hostname will be different):
+
----
$ cd ~/pcf-ers-demo/
$ cf push attendees-v2 -p ./pcf-ers-demo1-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar -m 768M -n attendees-doxastic-progenitiveness-temp --no-start
----
+
. Bind attendees-v2 to the attendee-service user provided service.
+
----
$ cf bind-service attendees-v2 attendee-service
----
_You can ignore the "TIP: Use 'cf restage attendees-v2' to ensure your env variable changes take effect" message at this time._
+
. Start the application.
+
----
$ cf start attendees-v2
----
+
. Now we have two versions of our app deployed.
+
Open a new tab and view version 2 of `attendees` in your browser. Take note of the application name.
+
image::blue_green2.png[]
+
At this point in the deployment process, you could do further testing of the version you are about to release before exposing customers to it.
+
. Let's assume we are ready to start directing production traffic to version 2. We need to map our production route to `attendees-v2`.
+
For example (your domain and hostname may be different):
+
----
$ cf map-route attendees-v2 apps.pcf.homelab.lan -n attendees-doxastic-progenitiveness
----
+
. Return to browser tab where you started the load. You should see that it is starting to send requests to version 2.
+
image::blue_green3.png[]
+
. Press the `Reset` button, so we can see how the load get distributed across app instances.
+
If you are running with a similar configuration to this:
+
----
-> cf apps
Getting apps in org mborges-org / space development as admin...
OK

name                     requested state   instances   memory   disk   urls
attendees                started           2/2         768M     1G     ...
attendees-v2             started           1/1         768M     1G     ...
----
You should see about a third of the requests going to version 2.
+
image::blue_green4.png[]
+
. Move more traffic to version 2.
+
----
$ cf scale attendees -i 1
$ cf scale attendees-v2 -i 2
----
+
If you `Reset` the load generator, you will see 2/3 of the traffic go to `attendees-v2`.
. Move all traffic to version 2.
+
Remove the production route from the `attendees` application.
+
For example (your domain and hostname may be different):
+
----
$ cf unmap-route attendees apps.pcf.homelab.lan -n attendees-doxastic-progenitiveness
----
If you `Reset` the load generator, you will see all the traffic goes to `attendees-v2`.
+
image::blue_green5.png[]
+
*_NOTE:_* Refreshing the entire page will update the application name.
+
. Remove the temp route from the attendees-v2 application.
+
For example (your domain and hostname may be different):
+
----
$ cf unmap-route attendees-v2 cfapps-01.haas-66.pez.pivotal.io -n attendees-heartsickening-elegance-temp
----
*Congratulations!* You performed a blue-green deployment.

=== Questions
* How would a rollback situation be handled using a blue-green deployment?
* What other design implications does running at least two versions at the same time have on your applications?
* Do you do blue-green deployments today? How is this different?

== Cleanup
Let's reset our environment.

. Delete the attendees application.
+
----
$ cf delete attendees
----
+
. Rename attendees-v2 to attendees.
+
----
$ cf rename attendees-v2 attendees
----
+
. Restart attendees.
+
----
$ cf restart attendees
----
+
. Scale down.
+
----
$ cf scale attendees -i 1
----
