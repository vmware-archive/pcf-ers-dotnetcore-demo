= Push the demo application

The prime directive of Pivotal Cloud Foundry is to host applications. We are going to exercise that directive by pushing a very simple Spring application.

By the end of this lab you should have your attendees application up and running in your account.
--

Estimated Time: 30 minutes

== Set your target environment

. If you haven't already, download the latest release of the Cloud Foundry CLI from https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases for your operating system and install it.

. Set the API target for the CLI:
+
----
$ cf api --skip-ssl-validation https://api.<DOMAIN_PROVIDED_BY_INSTRUCTOR>
----

. Login to Pivotal Cloud Foundry:
+
----
$ cf login
----
+
Follow the prompts, entering in the student credentials provided by the instructor and choosing the development space.

== Build (or Download) and Push!

Change to the _attendees_ sample application directory:
----
$ cd $COURSE_HOME
----

=== Download

If you cannot run the maven script to build:

. Download the attendees1-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar file https://bintray.com/mborges-pivotal/generic/attendees1/head#files[here]
. Create the directory `/build/libs/`.
. Place the .jar file in the `/build/libs/` directory.
. Skip down to the 'Push' section.

=== Build

Use the Maven Wrapper to build and package the application:

----
$ ./mvnw package -DskipTests
----

The Maven Wrapper will automatically download the appropriate version of Maven for this project along with all of _attendees_'s dependencies. This may take a few moments.

=== Push

Now use the `cf push` command to push the application to PCF!

----
$ cf push
----

You should see output similar to the following listing. Take a look at the listing callouts for a play-by-play of what's happening:

<1> The CLI is using a manifest to provide necessary configuration details such as application name, memory to be allocated, and path to the application artifact.
Take a look at `manifest.yml` to see how.
<2> In most cases, the CLI indicates each Cloud Foundry API call as it happens.
In this case, the CLI has created an application record for _attendees_ in your assigned space.
<3> All HTTP/HTTPS requests to applications will flow through Cloud Foundry's front-end router called http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/architecture/router.html[(Go)Router].
Here the CLI is creating a route with random word tokens inserted (again, see `manifest.yml` for a hint!) to prevent route collisions across the default PCF domain.
<4> Now the CLI is _binding_ the created route to the application.
Routes can actually be bound to multiple applications to support techniques such as http://www.mattstine.com/2013/07/10/blue-green-deployments-on-cloudfoundry[blue-green deployments].
<5> The CLI finally uploads the application bits to PCF. Notice that it's uploading _90 files_! This is because Cloud Foundry actually explodes a ZIP artifact before uploading it for caching purposes.
<6> Now we begin the staging process. The https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack[Java Buildpack] is responsible for assembling the runtime components necessary to run the application.
<7> Here we see the version of the JRE that has been chosen and installed.
<8> The complete package of your application and all of its necessary runtime components is called a _droplet_.
Here the droplet is being uploaded to PCF's internal blobstore so that it can be easily copied to one or more _http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/diego/diego-components.html#cell-components[Diego Cells]_ for execution.
<9> The CLI tells you exactly what command and argument set was used to start your application.
<10> Finally the CLI reports the current status of your application's health.
You can get the same output at any time by typing `cf app attendees`.
====

Visit the application in your browser by hitting the route that was generated by the CLI.  You can find the route by typing `cf apps`, and it will look something like `https://attendees-naturopathic-souple.<DOMAIN-PROVIDED-BY-INSTRUCTOR>`

Take a look at the `Application Environment Information` section on the top right-hand corner of the UI.
This gives you important information about the state of the currently running _attendees_ instance, including what application instance index and what Cloud Foundry services are bound.
It will become important in the next lab!
