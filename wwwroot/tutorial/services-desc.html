<p>In this page we can exercise how applications in PCF can use
	services. By default the applications uses H2 as an embedded database
	but it auto detects and uses any PCF database bound to it.</p>

<p>The diagram below illustrates the PCF components. We have Ops
	Manager controlling the provisioning of services where PCF ERS is the
	core platform runtime services.</p>

<p>Pivotal Ops manager can also provision and manage other services.
	The Service Broker components implements an PCF ERS API that allows
	services to expose their catalog in the PCF Marketplace where they can
	create service instances.</p>

<p>
	We understand that not all the platform services are managed by it. So
	you can implement your own Service Broker and registere with PCF ERS or
	you can simply use the concpet of User Provided Services. <a
